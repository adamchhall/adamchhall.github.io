				<h1>Hello! I'm Adam.</h1>
				<p>I am a statistician and data scientist interested in methods for learning about and improving the world, and also anything that's just cool. Some of my most important work has included:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Developing and estimating <a href="Full Dissertation Thesis.pdf">new price indices based on barcode scanner data</a> to help determine the cost of living in small areas</li>
					<li><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00080683231215985">Assisting</a> with the development, implementation, and communication of the <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/13/6/945">statistical models</a> that decide which communities receive <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/voting-rights/voting-rights-determination-file.html">foreign language voting materials</a></li>
					<li>Developing <a href="https://www2.census.gov/library/working-papers/2024/adrm/RRS2024-07.pdf"> novel methods</a> of <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/13935802">comparing several competing estimates</a> of the same unknown parameter to help validate new population estimates</li>
					<li>Writing <a href="https://github.com/adamchhall/RankingProject">backend code</a> for experimental <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/research/stat-research/ranking.html">data visualizations</a> of the uncertainty in the ranks of noisy estimates</li>
					<li>Writing the public <a href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/rdo/about/2020-census-program/Phase3/SupportMaterials/2020PL_R_import_scripts.zip">R statistical software import scripts</a> for the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/rdo/summary-files.html">2020 P.L. 94-171 Redistricting Data</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p>I mostly write code in <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">R</a>, 
				<a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, and <a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> to accomplish these tasks. I 
				typically use <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/get/">LaTeX</a> or <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a> 
				to document the results.</p>
				</br>
				<p>I earned my bachelors degree at <a href="https://www.uci.edu">UC Irvine</a> and my PhD at the <a href="https://www.umich.edu">University of Michigan</a>.</p> 
				</br>
				<p>In my spare time I like to travel, go hiking, take art classes, read sci-fi, history, philosophy and social science, and 
				play video games.</p>

			<h1>Experience</h1>

			<h3>Research Mathematical Statistician at the Census Bureau</h3>

			<p>As a Research Mathematical Statistician, I performed research related to the planning, collection, processing, anlaysis, and dissemination of data applicable to censuses, large scale sample surveys, 
				and other data sources (e.g. administrative data and big data).</p>
			<p>Research utilized knowledge and skills from statistical theory and methodology, survey methodology, statistical computing, computer science, economics, demography, and social and behavioral sciences.</p>




			<h3>Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) Internship</h3>

			<p>Researched the process by which raw price quotes are aggregated to regional price parities.</p>
			<p>Wrote press releases, reviewed data before release, and used SAS to produce supplementary tables.</p>
			<p>Used SAS with data from the ACS Public Use Microdata Sample to estimate rents at the county level, and compared these to estimates obtained using internal Census data.</p>

			<h3>CSCAR Consultant</h3>
			<img class="scaleableimg leftfloat" src="cscar.png" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" alt="A logo for CSCAR."/>
			<p><a href="https://cscar.research.umich.edu/">CSCAR</a> is the "Center for Statistics, Computing &amp; Analytics Research" at the University of Michigan.
				They provide statistical consulting services for university affiliated researchers.</p>

			<p>As a CSCAR consultant, I helped graduate students and faculty resolve statistical questions related to their research.
				I also helped clients schedule appointments with more experienced consultants for clients with difficult problems requiring more specialized knowledge.</p>
			<p>Common concerns that I helped with included:
				<ul>
					<li>Analyzing dependent data</li>
					<li>Study design</li>
					<li>Correctly interpreting results</li>
					<li>Using statistical software such as SPSS</li>
					<li>Writing scripts in R and/or Python to clean, analyze, and/or visualize data</li>
					<li>Using High Performance Computing (HPC) resources</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h3>Graduate Student Instructor (GSI)</h3>
			<img class="scaleableimg" src="teaching.png" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" alt="A web comic with a bad pun about abstracts."/>
			<br>
			<p>As a GSI at the University of Michigan, my duties have included lecturing about statistical tools and topics, explaining material in office hours, grading exams and homework assignments, writing questions for quizzes, and teaching R and SPSS.
				I have taught labs for the following courses:</p>
			<table>

				<tr>
					<td><b>Stats 413: Applied Regression Analysis<br></b></td>
					<td>Stats 413 is an introduction course to regression analysis. The course covers linear methods for regression
							and classification, and methods for non-linear regression. Tentative topics include:
							Ordinary Least Squares (OLS): Properties of OLS, Hypothesis Testing, Model Selection
							Shrinkage methods: Ridge Regression, Lasso
							Generalized Linear Models
							Methods of Non-Linear Regression (if time permits).
							This course covers material from both a theoretical and an applied perspective.</td>
					<td class="phonehide"><ul><li>Spring 2019</li></ul></td>
